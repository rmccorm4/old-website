# Welcome to my website!

Hi, I'm Ryan McCormick. I'm an incoming junior at Binghamton University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I love to learn and be challenged, and I find space and the physics related to it, to be extremely cool.

# Coolest Projects At The Moment

## Pokefetch
This is a neat terminal tool I am working on that basically puts a pokedex right in your shell using Bash and Python!
You just run the command:
```
./pokefetch.sh <pokemon_name>
```
and get a nice picture and relevant information on the pokemon right there in a screenfetch-esque fashion.

For a more detailed description, you can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/rmccorm4/Pokefetch).

## Archon
This is currently a very basic programming language that I am writing from scratch with my friend Thomas in Python.
I enjoy constantly learning as much as possible, as long as it interests me, and this project is something I plan to work
on long term, as it has seemingly-endless possibilities, especially for two people to work on.

The current progress is kept [here](https://github.com/rmccorm4/Archon), but there isn't much to see.
