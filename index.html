			<h1>About me</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>I'm an incoming junior at Binghamton University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I love to learn and be challenged, and outside of my majors I find space and the physics related to it to be extremely cool!</p>
			<p>Current interests relevant to my major include programming languages, time and space complexity, shell scripting, python, webscraping, and neural networks. Specifically with programming languages, I'm enjoying learning about all of the inner workings of compilers, interpreters, parsers, lexers, and how they complement each other.</p>

			<h1>Notable Current Projects</h1>
			<hr>

			<h2>Pokefetch</h2>
			<p>This is a neat terminal tool I am on working on that basically puts a pokedex in your shell using Bash and Python! </p>
			<p> <img src="images/oldschool_sprite.png"/> </p>
			<p>For a more detailed description and how to download it for yourself, you can find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Pokefetch">here</a>.</p>

			<br>

			<h2>Archon</h2>
			<p>This is currently a very basic programming language that I am writing from scratch with my friend Thomas in Python. I enjoy constantly learning as much as possible, as long as it interests me, and this project is something I plan to work on long term, as it has seemingly-endless possibilities, especially for two people to work on.</p>
			<p>The current progress is kept <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Archon">here</a>, but there isn't much to see yet.</p>

			<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
			<hr>

			<h2>ATRC Intern</h2>
			<p>Currently I am 'Automatic Target Recognition Center Intern' at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. I am conducting research with a graduate student on representations of convolutional neural networks in order to better understand how and why they work. There are many unanswered questions in the field regarding why neural networks perform so well, and its usually just described as magic. Our goal is to de-mystify that magic this summer as well as get a publication out of the work.</p>

			<h2>ICIP 2017</h2>
			<p>In my first three semesters at Binghamton University, I conducted research through the Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program. Under the guidance of Dr. Shaun Canavan, I worked alongside several other students to create a real time hand-gesture classification system for the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. We used the Leap Motion controller for gathering data and used C++ and it's random forest library RFLib for the classification.</p>
			<p>Here is a demo of our work:</p>
