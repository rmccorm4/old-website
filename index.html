<p>I'm Ryan McCormick, an incoming junior at Binghamton University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I love to learn and be challenged, and I find space and the physics related to it, to be extremely cool.</p>

<p>| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Pokefetch  | This is a neat terminal tool I am working on that basically puts a pokedex right in your shell using Bash and Python! You just run the command: <code>./pokefetch.sh &lt;pokemon_name&gt;</code> and get a nice picture and relevant information on the pokemon right there in a screenfetch-esque fashion. For a more detailed description, you can find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Pokefetch">here</a>. |
| Archon     | This is currently a very basic programming language that I am writing from scratch with my friend Thomas in Python. I enjoy constantly learning as much as possible, as long as it interests me, and this project is something I plan to work on long term, as it has seemingly-endless possibilities, especially for two people to work on. The current progress is kept <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Archon">here</a>, but there isn't much to see. |</p>
