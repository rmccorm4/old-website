<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<p><img src="imgs/brooklyn_small.png?raw=true" alt="Picture of me" title="Big fat nerd" /></p>

<p>Hi, I'm Ryan McCormick. I'm an incoming junior at Binghamton University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I love to learn and be challenged, and I find space and the physics related to it, to be extremely cool.</p>

<h1>Coolest Projects At The Moment</h1>

<h2>Pokefetch</h2>

<p>This is a neat terminal tool I am working on that basically puts a pokedex right in your shell using Bash and Python!
You just run the command:
<code>
./pokefetch.sh &lt;pokemon_name&gt;
</code>
and get a nice picture and relevant information on the pokemon right there in a screenfetch-esque fashion.</p>

<p>For a more detailed description, you can find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Pokefetch">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Archon</h2>

<p>This is currently a very basic programming language that I am writing from scratch with my friend Thomas in Python.
I enjoy constantly learning as much as possible, as long as it interests me, and this project is something I plan to work
on long term, as it has seemingly-endless possibilities, especially for two people to work on.</p>

<p>The current progress is kept <a href="https://github.com/rmccorm4/Archon">here</a>, but there isn't much to see.</p>
